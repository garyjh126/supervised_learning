# Assignment Two


## Task: supervised learning, get good generalisation.

We have numeric input data, 8 dimensional, and binary classification.

## You are given:

* File `train.txt`, a training set of 100,000 labelled inputs, roughly balanced between classes. Each line is one input-output pair, 9 numbers/line; the first 8 are the input, the last is the label (0/1).

* File `test.txt`, a test set of 10,000 unlabelled inputs.  Each line is one input, 8 numbers/line.

## Other details

All the inputs, both training and testing, were drawn iid from the same distribution.
